### Scaling vertically

First, scale the memory limit of the `my-app` application:

```sh
cf scale my-app -m 512M
```

Output should be:

```
$ cf scale my-app  -m 512M

This will cause the app to restart. Are you sure you want to scale my-app?> y

```

Since this is a VERY small application that barelly consumes memory, we can shrink down the memory usage to 64M safely:

```sh
cf scale my-app -m 64M -f
```

You will see that the application is restarted.
Now check the status with the `cp app my-app` command.
You can verify that both instances were restarted!
