### Scaling horizontally

Try scaling up the number of instances of your application to 2:

```sh
cf scale my-app -i 2
```

Output should be:

```
$ cf scale my-app -i 2
Scaling app my-app in org my-org / space my-first-space as my-user...
OK
```

Now, check the status of the application:

```sh
cf app my-app
```

You can see that there are now two instances running of `my-app`!
