Target your Org and Space
-------------------------

Target an Org and a Space means that all operations you will be doing will be performed in that Org and Space.

This is done by using the `cf target` command.

Use `cf target` for setting the CLI in the **training** org and the space that you just created and assigned permissions to.

```sh
cf target -o training -s test-space
```
