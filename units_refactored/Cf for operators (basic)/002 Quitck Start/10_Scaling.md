Scaling
-------

There are two ways to scale applications in CF: vertically and horizontally. Us the `cf scale` command to try both scaling strategies:
* Vertically, by increasing the memory of the instance. Observe: what happens when changing the size of an instance?
* Horizontally, by adding more instances of the application. Observe: what difference can you find with vertical scallation strategy?

Next, reduce the instances of the application again to 1.
