Scaling applications
--------------------

There are two ways to scale applications in CF: vertical and horizontal. Use the `cf scale` command to try both scaling strategies:

* Scale *vertically* by increasing the memory of the instance. 
    Observe: What happens when you change the size of an instance?
* Scale *horizontally* by adding more instances of the application. 
    Observe: What is the difference between vertical and horizontal scaling?

Next, reduce the number of application instances back to 1.
