### What is Cloud Foundry?

[Cloud Foundry](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/) is a PaaS, a Platform as a Service. This means that we can define Cloud Foundry as a series of components that are deployed in an Infrastructure as a Service (such as Amazon's AWS, OpenStack, vCloud, vSphere) that will allow developers to deploy applications extremely fast without worrying about the underlying infrastructure, and will allow DevOps to provide a secure, predictable, resilient and flexible platform to be used by the stakeholders.
