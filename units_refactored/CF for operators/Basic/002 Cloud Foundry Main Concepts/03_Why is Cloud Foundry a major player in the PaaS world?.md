### Why is Cloud Foundry a major player in the PaaS world?

Cloud Foundry is probably the most deployed, tested, and well-known open-source PaaS that can be privately deployed. The major reasons for this are threefold:

* First, its development is guided by the <a href="https://www.cloudfoundry.org/foundation/" target="_blank">Cloud Foundry Foundation</a>, which ensures that all development efforts, product releases, communities, and events are done by and for all of the Foundation's members.
* Second, market leaders, like EMC, VMWare, Pivotal, IBM, Intel, SAP and HP, are helping to build Cloud Foundry by contributing in many ways.
* Third, Cloud Foundry's list of users is impressive: EMC, Pivotal, IBM, SAP, HP, Intel, Hospira, Huawai, Baidu, GE Aviation, and AllState are some of the companies using Cloud Foundry in production, with more joining this exciting community every day.
