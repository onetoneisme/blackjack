### Overview

This course is an introduction to Cloud Foundry (CF) from an operator perspective. We cover what Cloud Foundry is and how to deploy it in AWS.  We also touch briefly upon using the Cloud Foundry platform, including creating users and other entities.

### Target audience

This course was designed for IT operations engineers who want to learn the basics of Cloud Foundry and quickly get up and running with the open-source version of the platform.

### Course objectives

Upon completion of this course, you should be able to:

- Have a basic understanding of Cloud Foundry
- Have a basic understanding of BOSH
- Use BOSH to deploy Cloud Foundry to AWS
- Create Cloud Foundry organizations, spaces, users, and quotas

### Prerequisites

You'll need an AWS account, AWS access keys, and a Web browser.  Basic knowledge of Linux and AWS from the command-line is helpful, but not required.

Note: We recommend that you create temporary AWS Access Keys that can be later destroyed when the course is complete.

You must also have a functioning Cloud Foundry deployment and jumphost.  For this lesson, we'll use MicroPCF, a single-VM solution that provides functionality of both. Create a MicroPCF instance by selecting `Create New > MicroPCF` from the Manage Infrastructure page in the training platform.
