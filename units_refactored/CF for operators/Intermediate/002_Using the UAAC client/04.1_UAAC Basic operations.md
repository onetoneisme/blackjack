### UAAC Basic operations

#### Connection to Cloud Foundry's UAA server

First, target your deployment:

```sh
uaac target uaa.{{echo $CF_DOMAIN}} --skip-ssl-validation
```
> **Tip**: we are targeting the *uaa* endpoint instead of the *api*. This is because the UAAC connects and operates straight to the UAA component.
> **Warning**: notice that, again, we are skipping SSL validation when connection to the UAA. This is NOT recommended for real life deployments.

For the next step, you will need to know the **uaa:admin:client:secret** property from Cloud Foundry's deployment manifest.
In this case, and for the sake of simplicity, we will provide it: *admin-secret*

Well, that "secret" is not so much, but we will learn how to change it in a different lesson.

Second step, get authorized to use the UAAC:

```sh
uaac token client get admin -s admin-secret
```

This should output something like:

```sh
$ uaac token client get admin -s admin-secret

Successfully fetched token via client credentials grant.
Target: https://uaa.{{ echo $CF_DOMAIN }}
Context: admin, from client admin
```
