### Viewing security groups

The CLI offers a wide variety of ways to display information about our security groups:

- To view all the security groups in the current org, use the `cf security-groups` command.
- To view the security groups bound to the **Default Staging** set, use the `cf staging-security-groups` command.
- To view the security groups bound to the **Default Running** set, use the `cf running-security-groups` command.
- To view detailed information about a security group, use the `cf security-group SECURITY-GROUP-NAME` command. In our example, the command will be `cf security-group mysql-sg`:

```sh
$ cf security-group mysql-sg
Getting info for security group mysql-sg as admin
OK
