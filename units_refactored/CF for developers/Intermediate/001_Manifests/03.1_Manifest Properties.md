#### More properties

Immediately below the memory, we will specify que disk quota:

```yaml
---
applications:
- name: "my-app"
  memory: 128M
  disk_quota: 256M
```

Now our application has some limits!
Lets add another another attribute, this time an application startup timetout, in seconds:

```yaml
---
applications:
- name: "my-app"
  memory: 128M
  disk_quota: 256M
  timeout: 120
```

Also, lets add the `host` attribute to specify that we want our app to be reached as `my-precious-app.{{ echo CF_DOMAIN }}`.
The `host` property will generate a route (more on routes later), but for all the CLI operations, the app will still be named `my-app`.

```yaml
---
applications:
- name: "my-app"
  memory: 128M
  disk_quota: 256M
  timeout: 120
  host: "my-precious-app"
```

Now, do `cf push`, without specifying any command line option.
You should have your `my-app` running with 128M memory limit and 256M disk quota, and accesible [here](http://my-precious-app.{{ echo CF_DOMAIN }})
