### III. Config
#### Store config in the environment

An appâ€™s config is everything that is likely to vary between deploys (staging, production, development environments, etc). This includes:

* Resource handles to the database, Memcached, and other backing services
* Credentials to external services, such as Amazon S3 or Twitter
* Per-deploy values, such as the canonical hostname for the deploy
* Apps sometimes store config as constants in the code. This is a violation of the twelve-factor methodology, which requires **strict separation of config from code**. Config varies substantially across deploys, code does not.

A litmus test for whether an app has all its config correctly factored out of the code is whether the codebase can be made open source at any moment, without compromising any credentials.

Twelve-factor apps store config in *environment variables* (often shortened to *env vars* or *env*). Env vars are easy to change between deploys without changing any code. Unlike config files, there is little chance of them being checked into the code repo accidentally and, unlike custom config files or other config mechanisms, such as Java System Properties, they are a language and an OS-agnostic standard.

To access CF environment variables via Spring, you need to use the `org.springframework.core.env.Environment` class.
Change the `StockResource` class with the following code:
```
    @Autowired
    private Environment environment;

    @RequestMapping(value = "/ping", method = RequestMethod.GET)
    public String ping() {
        return "Ping" + " " + environment.getProperty("environment.variable");
    }
```
Execute:
```
$ mvn clean install
$ cf push workshop-12f-stock -p target/{project-name}-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```
Now, if you access `http://workshop-12f-stock.{{echo $CF_DOMAIN}}/stock/ping` you will get `"Ping null"` as the output. It is because we haven't set any environmrnt variable values yet. Let's do it:
```
$ cf set-env workshop-12f-stock environment.variable some_value
```
Next, restart your app:
```
cf restart workshop-12f-stock
```

Access `http://workshop-12f-stock.{{echo $CF_DOMAIN}}/stock/ping` and make sure that the output is `"Ping some_value"`.
