### Viewing events

An *event* is something that happens to your application at deployment level. It is different from an internal application log. Application logs are generated by the application. An event log is generated by Cloud Foundry itself. All actions suffered by the application are recorded and can later be audited:

```sh
cf events my-app
```

Output should be similar to:

```
$ cf events my-app
Getting events for app my-app in org my-org / space my-first-space as my-user...

```

As you can see, these events are related to all the operations done by Cloud Foundry instead of what is going on INSIDE the application.
