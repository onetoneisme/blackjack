#### Custom startup command

Some Buildpacks will ask you to issue a custom startup command for your application.
In this case, we will issue a very simple command to start out app: `bundle exec rackup`. This command will execute the **Webrick** web server (good **ONLY** for development!) in the context of the installed gems (libraries).

```yaml
---
applications:
- name: "my-app"
  memory: 128M
  disk_quota: 256M
  timeout: 120
  host: "my-precious-app"
  command: "bundle exec rackup"
```
