### Introduction

[BOSH](http://bosh.io/docs/about.html) is a project that unifies release engineering, deployment, and lifecycle management of small and large-scale cloud software. BOSH can provision and deploy software over numerous VMs. It also performs monitoring, failure recovery, and software updates with zero-to-minimal downtime.
While BOSH was developed to deploy [Cloud Foundry](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/), it can also be used to deploy almost any other software (e.g. services). In  this course, we will use BOSH for installing and configuring Cloud Foundry deployment as well as other important components. But the first thing we are going to do is to install BOSH itself.
