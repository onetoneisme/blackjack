### Initialize an empty release

We need to begin with initializing a new release, using the following commands:

```exec
mkdir   ~/greeter-release
cd ~/greeter-release
bosh init-release
```

After executing this command, the filesystem tree should look like this:

```
$ tree
.
├── blobs
├── config
│   └── blobs.yml
├── jobs
├── packages
└── src
```
