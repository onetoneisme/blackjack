# Cloud Foundry Main Concepts

## Objective

In this lesson you will learn what is Cloud Foundry, why it matters and basic concepts about it's architecture and inner workings.

Then you will move to install Cloud Foundry's CLI tool as well as some basic configuration for it and how to get help from the CLI.

### ToC

1. What is Cloud Foundry?
2. Why is Cloud Foundry a major player in the PaaS world?
3. Cloud Foundry architecture
4. Cloud Foundry's CLI installation
5. CLI's enviromental variables
6. Getting help

## What Is Cloud Foundry?

[Cloud Foundry](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/) is a PaaS, a Platform as a Service. This means that we can define Cloud Foundry as a series of components that are deployed in an Infrastructure as a Service (such as Amazon's AWS, OpenStack, vCloud, vSphere) that will allow developers to deploy applications extremely fast without worrying about the underlying infrastructure, and will allow DevOps to provide a secure, predictable, resilient and flexible platform to be used by the stakeholders.

### Why is Cloud Foundry a major player in the PaaS world?

Cloud Foundry is probably the most deployed, tested and well known open source PaaS that can be privately deployed.
First, it's development is guided by the [Cloud Foundry foundation](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/foundation/), which ensures that all development efforts, product releases, communities and events are done by and for all of the Foundation's members.
Second, market leaders like EMC, VMWare, Pivotal, IBM, Intel, SAP and HP are helping build Cloud Foundry by contributing in many ways.
Third, Cloud Foundry's list of users is impressive: EMC, Pivotal, IBM, SAP, HP, Intel, Hospira, Huawai, Baidu, GE Aviation, AllState are some of the companies using Cloud Foundry in production, with more joining this exciting community every day.

### Cloud Foundry's architecture

A very good read on Cloud Foundry's architecture and components can be found [here](http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/concepts/architecture/). We strongly suggest that you read that document before proceeding to the next step.
