Connecting to the Cloud Foundry API
------------------------

Cloud Foundry provides an API endpoint to perform different operations and interact seamlessly with the whole foundation.

Using the CLI requires that you connect to the CF API for the CLI to know where to send the commands.

To connect to Cloud Foundry's API, you need to use the `cf api` command.

```sh
cf api --skip-ssl-validation https://api.{{echo $CF_DOMAIN}}
```

In case the connection was successful, the following information will be displayed:

```
Setting api endpoint to https://api.{{echo $CF_DOMAIN}}...
OK
```

> **Important**: we are using `--skip-ssl-validation` since the Cloud Foundry deployment we are using for this course doesn't have a trusted SSL certificate installed, but as a good practice for development and testing, and mandatory for production, a trusted SSL cert should always be present.

Now, you need to provide credentials. This is accomplished through the interactive command `cf login`. For this part of the training course, use the `admin` / `admin` credentials. Enter user name (admin) when asked for Email.

> **Tip**: you can also use the `cf login` command setting the API: `cf login --skip-ssl-validation -a https://api.{{echo $CF_DOMAIN}}`
