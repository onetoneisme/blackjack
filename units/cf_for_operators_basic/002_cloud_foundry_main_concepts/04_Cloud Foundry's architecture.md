### Cloud Foundry's Architecture

Cloud Foundry is a collection of open-source software that provides an elastic runtime, traffic routing, user authentication, access controls, aggregated logging, metrics collection, and various other capabilities.

The components can reside on a single host or VM, typically for local development and testing, or be distributed across many hosts and availability zones for scalability and redundancy purposes, as it is typical for production deployment scenarios.

A good overview of Cloud Foundry's architecture and components can be found <a href="http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/concepts/architecture/" target="_blank">here</a>. We strongly suggest you review that document before proceeding to the next step.
