### What is Cloud Foundry?

<a href="https://www.cloudfoundry.org/" target="_blank">Cloud Foundry</a> is an open-source Platform as a Service (PaaS).

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> defines a PaaS as "a category of cloud computing services that provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications without the complexity of building and maintaining the infrastructure typically associated with developing and launching an app."

Cloud Foundry itself is a series of components that are deployed on top of an Infrastructure-as-a-Service (such as Amazon's AWS, OpenStack, vCloud, vSphere, and Azure) and, as noted in the paragraph above, allows developers to deploy applications extremely fast without concerning themselves with the underlying infrastructure, and also allows DevOps engineers to easily provide a secure, predictable, resilient, and flexible platform.
