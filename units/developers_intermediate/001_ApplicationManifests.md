# Application manifests

### What you are going to learn:

1. Creating application manifests
1. Manifests properties
2. Creating a complex manifest
3. Binding services in manifests

In a previous lesson we created a basic *application manifest* that served us as an example on how to deploy an application without specifying the application name.

But manifests can become complex, due to the wide variety of properties that you can set.
