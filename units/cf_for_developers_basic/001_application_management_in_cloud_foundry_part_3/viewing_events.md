### Viewing events

An *event* is something that happens to your application at the deployment level. It is different from an internal application log. Application logs are generated by the application. An event log is generated by Cloud Foundry itself. All actions suffered by the application are recorded and can later be audited:

```exec
cf events my-app
```

As you can see, all these events are related to the operations performed by Cloud Foundry and NOT what is going on *inside* the application.
