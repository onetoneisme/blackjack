### Installing the UAAC

The UAAC is written in [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org) and distributed as a [Ruby gem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RubyGems). Ruby has been pre-installed on your training jumpbox, so you don't have to install it manually.

To install the UAAC, you can do:

```sh
gem install cf-uaac
```

This will output something like:

```
$ gem install cf-uaac
Fetching: cf-uaac-3.1.7.gem (100%)
Successfully installed cf-uaac-3.1.7
Parsing documentation for cf-uaac-3.1.7
Installing ri documentation for cf-uaac-3.1.7
Done installing documentation for cf-uaac after 0 seconds
1 gem installed
```

Just to try it, type:

```sh
uaac help
```

It should show a lot of output with the commands and options the UAAC provides.
